      "2. **Investigate BBQ design for potential improvements in heating efficiency and temperature management instructions or tips**: This may be easier to implement as it could involve tweaks to the current design rather than a full redesign. Providing better instructions or tips could be quite straightforward and cost-effective. \n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Reassess the build quality and ignition system for durability and reliability**: This is essential for customer trust and product longevity. Improving the quality of materials or manufacturing processes might be moderately difficult but important for long-term brand reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Review the BBQ design to improve sturdiness and heat control consistency**: This might be easier to implement compared to a complete redesign and is crucial for user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Improve ease of setup and ensure even heating; making a version with more grill space**: Easing the setup process could involve clearer instructions or minor design changes and is thus relatively easy to implement. Providing more grill space without compromising portability may require a significant redesign.\n",

      "Based on customer feedback frequency and ease of implementation, the prioritized actions might be:\n",

      "- **Easiest to Implement**:\n",
      "    1. Provide clearer instructions or tips for optimal temperature management.\n",
      "    2. Improve ease of setup with better instructions or minor design adjustments.\n",
